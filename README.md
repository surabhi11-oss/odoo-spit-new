Problem statement:
The StockMaster project is an Inventory Management System designed to replace manual registers and Excel tracking by providing a centralized dashboard for managing all stock operations. It lets users add products, track incoming receipts, outgoing deliveries, internal warehouse transfers, and stock adjustments, while showing key metrics like low-stock items, total inventory, and pending operations. The system supports multiple warehouses, SKU search, categories, and a detailed move history for transparency. Overall, it aims to make inventory handling faster, accurate, and fully digital.
